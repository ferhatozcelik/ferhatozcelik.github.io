                        by your mobile network provider, but Ferhat OZCELIK
                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                        have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                        other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along the same lines, Ferhat OZCELIK cannot always take
                        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                        Ferhat OZCELIK cannot accept responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to Ferhat OZCELIK’s responsibility for your
                        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                        to you. Ferhat OZCELIK accepts no liability for any
                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                        currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                        both systems(and for any additional systems we
                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. Ferhat OZCELIK does not promise that it
                        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the info@ferhatozcelik.com
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                        from your device.
